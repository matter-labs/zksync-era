# Introduction

This document serves as the specification of the ZK Stack protocol. The goal of the ZK Stack is to power the internet of
value by creating an interoperable ecosystem of hyperchains. Each of these hyperchains will be powered by the zkEVM,
using zero-knowledge proofs.

These specs will provide a high level overview of the zkEVM and a full specification of its more technical components,
such as the prover, compiler, and the VM itself.

We also specify the foundations of the hyperchain ecosystem including hyperbridging.
