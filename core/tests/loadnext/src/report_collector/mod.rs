/// ReportCollector is an entity capable of analyzing everything that happens in the loadtest.
///
/// It is designed to be separated from the actual execution, so that logic of the execution does not
/// interfere with the logic of analyzing, reporting and decision making.
///
/// Report collector by its nature only receives reports and uses different collectors in order to analyze them.
/// Currently, only the following collectors are used:
///
/// - MetricsCollector, which builds time distribution histograms for each kind of performed action.
/// - OperationResultsCollector, a primitive collector that counts the amount of failures and decides whether
///   test is passed.
///
/// Other possible collectors that can be implemented:
///
/// - ScriptCollector, which records all the actions (including wallet private keys and signatures), which makes it
///   possible to reproduce test once again.
/// - RetryCollector, which analyzes the average amount of retries that have to be made in order to make operation
///   succeed.
/// - PrometheusCollector, which exposes the ongoing loadtest results to grafana via prometheus.
///
/// Note that if you'll decide to implement a new collector, be sure that adding an entry in it is cheap: if you want
/// to do some IO (file or web), it's better to divide collector in two parts: an actor which receives commands through
/// a channel, and a cheap collector interface which just sends commands to the channel. This is strongly recommended,
/// since there are many reports generated during the loadtest, and otherwise it will result in the report channel
/// queue uncontrollable growth.
