# Interop Overview

Interop (short for interoperability) is the ability of different systems to exchange and make use of information. 

In our case, interop refers specifically to seamless communication between ZKsync chains. That includes exchanging messages, and using the data gathered via exchanging the messages to enable more complex workflows.

This section provides up-to-date information about interop components (and components directly related to interop) that are either already part of mainnet or whose development is complete and awaiting a protocol upgrade for inclusion.

As a prerequisite to understanding the interop mechanism, the reader should familiarize themselves with the following documents:

- [Message Root](./message_root.md)
- [Forms of Finality](./forms_of_finality.md)

To date, we have completed the implementation of the foundational layer for all interop functionality: [cross-chain messages](./interop_messages.md).

Once youâ€™ve reviewed the above, you can explore examples of interop applications [here](./examples/README.md).
