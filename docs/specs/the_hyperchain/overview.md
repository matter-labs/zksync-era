# Overview

ZK Stack roll chains will be launched on L1 into a [shared bridge](./shared_bridge.md). The shared bridge will create an
ecosystem of chains, with shared standards, upgrades, and free flow of assets. This free flow of assets will be enabled
by [hyperbridges](./hyperbridges.md). Hyperbridges are trustless and cheap bridges between hyperchains, allowing
cross-chain function calls.
