# Witness generator Service

This crate provides the building blocks for running Witness generator. It consists of five rounds: 
BasicCircuits, LeafAggregation, NodeAggregation, RecursionTip and Scheduler. 
Each round has its own implemenatation of `JobManager` and `ArtifactsManager`.

The primitive exported by this lib is witness_generator_runner.

The rest of the codebase simply covers the internals of creating a runner, which is an implementation of
`ProverJobProcessor`.

## Job Manager

Job Manager is responsible for getting metadata from `ConnectionPool`, preparing a job 
(getting artifacts from `ObjectStore` and some verification keys from `VerificationKeyManager`)
and processing the job (generating witnesses with indermediate loading and saving proofs from `ObjectStore`).

## Artifacts Manager

Artifacts Manager is responsible for getting and saving artifacts from `ObjectStore` as well as 
saving results to database.

## Witness generator Runner

Runner is tied to correspoding tables depending on a round:
- BasicCircuits - `witness_inputs_fri` 
- LeafAggregation - `leaf_aggregation_witness_jobs_fri`
- NodeAggregation - `node_aggregation_witness_jobs_fri` 
- RecursionTip - `recursion_tip_witness_jobs_fri` 
- Scheduler - `scheduler_witness_jobs_fri` 

Runner operates over following object storage buckets: 
`WitnessInput`, `SchedulerWitnessJobsFri`, `LeafAggregationWitnessJobsFri`, `NodeAggregationWitnessJobsFri`, `ProverJobsFri`. 

Setup data should be provided as an implementation of
`VerificationKeyManager`.

### Job Picker

Interacts with the database to get a job, gets input artifacts from object store and loads some verifications keys.

### Executor

Generates witnesses, gets and saves intermediate results from object store.

### Job Saver

Persists information back to corresponding table and put the output artifacts to the corresponding object storage bucket.
