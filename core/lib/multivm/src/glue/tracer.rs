//! # Multivm Tracing
//!
//! The MultiVM tracing module enables Tracers support for different versions of virtual machines
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Different VM versions may have distinct requirements and types for Tracers. To accommodate these differences,
//! this module defines one primary trait:
//!
//! - `MultivmTracer<S, H>`: This trait represents a tracer that can be converted into a tracer for
//! specific VM version.
//!
//! Specific traits for each VM version, which supports Custom Tracers
//! - `IntoLatestTracer<S, H>`: This trait is responsible for converting a tracer
//! into a form compatible with the latest VM version.
//! It defines a method `latest` for obtaining a boxed tracer.
//!
//! - `IntoVmVirtualBlocksTracer<S, H>`:This trait is responsible for converting a tracer
//! into a form compatible with the vm_virtual_blocks version.
//! It defines a method `vm_virtual_blocks` for obtaining a boxed tracer.
//!
//! For `MultivmTracer` to be implemented, Tracer must implement all N currently
//! existing sub-traits.
//!
//! Any tracer compatible with the current VM automatically
//! supports conversion into the latest VM,
//! but the remaining traits required by the MultivmTracer should be implemented manually.
//! If a certain tracer is not intended to be used with VMs other than the latest one,
//! these traits should still be implemented, but one may just write a panicking implementation.
//!
//! ## Adding a new VM version
//!
//! To add support for one more VM version to MultivmTracer, one needs to:
//! - Create a new trait performing conversion to the specified VM tracer, e.g. `Into<VmVersion>Tracer`.
//! - Provide implementations of this trait for all the structures that currently implement `MultivmTracer`.
//! - Add this trait as a trait bound to the `MultivmTracer`.
//! - Add this trait as a trait bound for `T` in `MultivmTracer` implementation.
//! - Integrate the newly added method to the MultiVM itself (e.g. add required tracer conversions where applicable).
