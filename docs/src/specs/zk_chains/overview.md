# Overview

ZK Stack roll chains will be launched on L1 into a [shared bridge](./shared_bridge.md). The shared bridge will create an
ecosystem of chains, with shared standards, upgrades, and free flow of assets. This free flow of assets will be enabled
by [interop](./interop.md). It is the trustless and cheap way of communication between ZK Chains, allowing cross-chain
function calls.
