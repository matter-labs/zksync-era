# Further reading

The documentation in this section aimed to provide a practical overview of the prover workspace, e.g. help people to
understand how to run provers and what they do.

However, we have some documentation that is more focused on theory of proving in the
[core workspace docs](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest).

You may find the following articles helpful for general understanding of ZK proofs:

- [ZK intuition](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/advanced/13_zk_intuition.html).
- [ZK deeper overview](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/advanced/14_zk_deeper_overview.html).
- [Prover keys](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/advanced/15_prover_keys.html).
- [Overview of our ZK proving system implementation](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/specs/prover/overview.html).
