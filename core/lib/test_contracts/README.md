# ZKsync Era Test Contracts

This library exposes contracts used in ZKsync Era codebase for unit testing.

## Building

Building the library requires `yarn` installed globally. If there are any issues during build, it could be useful
to inspect build artifacts, which are located in one of `target/{debug,release}/build/zksync_test_contracts-$random_numbers` directories.
