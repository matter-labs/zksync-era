/// bound on most methods that work with [`Resource`].

/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use zksync_node_framework::resource::Resource;
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// /// An abstract interface you want to share.
/// /// Normally you want the interface to be thread-safe.
/// trait MyInterface: 'static + Send + Sync {
///     fn do_something(&self);
/// }
///
/// /// Resource wrapper.
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct MyResource(Arc<dyn MyInterface>);
///
/// impl Resource for MyResource {
///     fn name() -> String {
///         // It is a helpful practice to follow a structured naming pattern for resource names.
///         // For example, you can use a certain prefix for all resources related to a some component, e.g. `api`.
///         "common/my_resource".to_string()
///     }
