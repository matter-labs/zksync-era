# Understanding zkSync's Use of 4844 Blob Transactions

This article explains how zkSync is utilizing the new type of transaction called 4844 blob transactions to commit to the
public data (pubdata) to Ethereum Layer 1 (L1).

We will skip the technical details of 4844 blobs (you can find them [on eip4844 page][4844_docs]) and focus on how
zkSync specifically implements them.

## Before 4844: The Era of Calldata

Before the introduction of 4844 blobs, zkSync collected all its pubdata, which could be up to 120kb, and sent it as
'calldata' of the commitBatches transaction.

In these transactions, the contract would calculate a keccak hash of the data and use this hash in the proving process.
More precisely, this hash was stored as part of the block commitment and later used in the `proveBatches` function.

## The Change with 4844 Blob Transactions

The introduction of 4844 blobs brought several significant changes:

- Blob transactions have their own fee market. This means the cost of using blobs can be different from the cost of
  using gas.
- Ethereum users must pay for a whole blob, which is 128kb, regardless of how much data they actually use. This differs
  from calldata, where payment was based on the amount of data sent.
- The contents of the blobs are not directly accessible. Instead, the transaction contains unique KZG commitments to
  whole 128kb and ethereum offers precompiles to handle verification.

**In the first version, we will be using up to 2 blobs per batch - so 256kb of pubdata**

In this article, we will mainly discuss how we adapted our system, including our proving system, to work with these KZG
commitments.

**Why did Ethereum introduce these commitments instead of continuing with the previous calldata based system?**

The short answer is, that while the current version of Ethereum doesn't gain much from this change, the next version,
known as 'full Danksharding,' will greatly benefit from these commitments, as they will allow the addition of many more
blobs.

## Technical details

Let's go back to our problem statement:

**We have 128kb of data in L2, and we want to prove on L1 that the KZG commitment was constructed correctly from this
data.**

This proof and its verification are done in 14 steps, divided into three parts: inside the prover, inside the state
keeper, and finally within the L1 contract.

### Inside the prover

Most of this is done in either witness generator or a new circuit type 4844:

| step                       | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Split Data                 | Divide the data into 4096 units of 256-bit points.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Create Polynomial          | Form a polynomial `p` that passes through these points. For more clarity on this, refer to [Blobspace 101][blobspace_101]                                                                                         |
| Trusted Setup              | Obtain the [trusted setup][trusted_setup] values from Ethereum's KZG ceremony (also known as the specially encoded secret point 's').                                                                             |
| Compute Commitment         | [Calculate the commitment][compute_commitment] `(c = p(s))`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Versioned Hash:            | Generate a versioned hash (`vh = hash(c)`) which is more flexible and smaller in size than the commitment. (32 bytes vs 48), and will allow ethereum to move to other commitment systems in the future if needed. |
| Choose a Random Point:     | Select a 'random' point `x = hash(hash(data) \|\| vh)` using the [hash of the data and the versioned hash][random_point_selection]. This is ['Fiat-Shamir' transform][fiat_shamir]                                |
| Compute Polynomial Value:  | Calculate the value `p(x) = y`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Prepare for Circuit Input: | Ensure that `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` and `hash(data)` are part of [public input for the circuit][scheduler_expect_4844]                                                                                           |

### Inside the state keeper

| step                         | explanation                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collect Data                 | Get `c`, `x`, `y`, `opening_proof` from witness generator |
| Create New Transaction Type: | Form a new blob transaction with a special `0x3` type.    |

### Inside the L1 contract

| step                             | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Receive Inputs:                  | Get `c`, `x`, `y`, and `opening_proof` as transaction arguments from the [state keeper][executor_inputs], which calls the L1 contract.                                                                                      |
| Verification Hash:               | Obtain the verification hash through the BLOB_HASH precompile. [`_getBlobVersionedHash`][get_blob_vhash]                                                                                                                    |
| Use Precompile for Verification: | Apply a [precompile][precompile_4844] to check if `p(x) == y` using the version hash, `c` and `opening_proof`. This is where the KZG scheme plays a crucial role, allowing the proof without needing the entire polynomial. |
| Pass Public Input to Verifier    | Send `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` as public input to the verifier using [`_batchAuxiliaryOutput`][executor_aux].                                                                                                                |

This process simplifies how zkSync validates the attachment of 128kb of L2 data to L1, ensuring its correctness and
integrity.

### What, but why

#### Why does prover need to compute the commitment

The prover needs to come up with a 'random' point 'x' (otherwise we cannot apply the [Schwarz-Zippel
lemma][schwarz_zippel] ), so it has to be generated based on something.

We use the combination of hash of pubdata (that L1 contract unfortunately cannot verify), with blob versioned hash
(which L1 contract can check) - allowing it to verify that the point was really generated randomly.

#### Why do I need to pass blob proof to L1 contract

The execution layer only knows that a consensus layer has a blob with a given hash, and nothing more. So in order to
prove anything about the contents of the blob, you (as a caller) have to provide all the information. It is similar to
someone storing a full merkle tree, and you knowing only the root hash. If you want to prove the inclusion the caller
has to provide the full merkle path.

#### Why do I need to pass this information into the aux inputs of verifier

While we say, that verifier accepts public inputs (plural) - in practice it accepts a single hash, that is an aggregated
keccak of all the inputs.

And passing all the information there, is the only way to make sure that operator was not malicious (otherwise, operator
could pass some other data in a blob, with correct `x` and `y` etc, that would be completely different from the one that
prover was actually proving).

#### I thought that trusted setup is huge

When we are using KZG for our ZK proofs, we use `2^24` trusted setup (so 16M parameters), while with old proof system,
we even used `2^26`.

For 4844, as blobs have 'only' 4096 elements we use `2^12` trusted setup (so exactly 4096 one) - it is right here [in
the json file][trusted_setup_json]

#### What if blobs become more expensive than calldata

As blobs and calldata have seprate market fees, it might happen that blobs can become more expensive, that storing the
data in calldata.

That's why in the current implementation, we'll keep the possibility of going back to calldata based system in such
scenario. This will be a manual process, and we would still need to pay the higher fees for the couple batches that were
already closed (as with blobs, we might be able to fit 256kb vs 128 with calldata).

### Some additional code pointers

Our proof (as a part of the input), expects these 2 additional fields in [Scheduler AUX inputs][scheduler_aux]

```rust
pub struct BlockAuxilaryOutput<F: SmallField> {
    // ...
    pub eip4844_linear_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
    // these are:  keccak(versioned hash || opening point || evaluation value)
    pub eip4844_output_commitment_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
}

```

We prepare this object inside the [Executor.sol][executor_aux]:

```solidity
bytes32 auxiliaryOutputHash = keccak256(
    _batchAuxiliaryOutput(_newBatchData, _stateDiffHash, _blobCommitments, _blobHashes)
);
```
