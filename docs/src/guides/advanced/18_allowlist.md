# Contract Deployment Allowlist

This module restricts contract deployments on zkSync Era to a predefined list of approved addresses.

## Configuration

Configure via `api.web3_json_rpc.deployment_allowlist` in your node's YAML:

```YAML
api:
  web3_json_rpc:
    deployment_allowlist:
      http_file_url: "https://example.com/allowlist.json"
      refresh_interval_secs: 60
```

- `http_file_url` (required): HTTP(S) URL to the allowlist JSON.
- `refresh_interval_secs` (optional): Refresh interval in seconds (default: 300).

To disable, set:

```YAML
api:
  web3_json_rpc:
    deployment_allowlist: {}
```

---

## Allowlist Format

The JSON served at the specified URL file must contain:

```JSON
{
  "addresses": [
    "0x1234...abcd",
    "0xbeef...dead"
  ]
}
```

- Served as `application/json`.
- ETag headers supported (optional).

### How Allowlist Enforcement Works

When a transaction is submitted, the `WhitelistedDeployPoolSink` inspects the virtual machine (VM) execution output to
determine if it includes any contract deployments.

#### Detection Flow

1. The VM emits an event for each contract deployment:

   - `ContractDeployed(address deployer, bytes32 bytecodeHash, address contractAddress)`

2. These events are parsed from the `execution_output.events` field.

3. If any deployment events are found:

   - The deployer address (from topic[1]) is extracted.
   - The address is checked against the current in-memory allowlist (`SharedAllowList`).

4. If the deployer is **not** in the allowlist:

   - The transaction is **rejected** with a `DeployerNotInAllowList` error.
   - A log is written with the deployer address and transaction hash.

5. If all deployments are allowed:
   - The transaction is forwarded to the mempool via `MasterPoolSink`.

#### Example Check (Simplified)

- Deployment event detected → extract deployer address
- Check: `allowlist.contains(deployer_address)`
- If not found → reject transaction
- Otherwise → forward to mempool

## Behavior

- On tx submission: contract deployer is checked against the allowlist.
- If not listed → tx is rejected.
- On refresh: allowlist is reloaded via HTTP. Skipped if `304 Not Modified`.

### ETag Support

To reduce unnecessary network usage, the allowlist fetcher supports HTTP **ETag** headers:

- When the allowlist is first fetched, the response’s `ETag` header is cached.
- On subsequent requests, the client includes the header:

  If-None-Match: "<etag-value>"

- If the allowlist has **not changed**, the server responds with:

  304 Not Modified

  and the in-memory list remains unchanged.

#### Notes

- ETag support is optional but recommended.
- If the server does **not** return an `ETag`, the allowlist will be re-fetched and re-parsed every interval.
- The ETag value is stored in memory only (not persisted across restarts).
