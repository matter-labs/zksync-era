/// Test pool uses an established transaction to be created. This transaction, in its turn,
/// is used to establish a *subtransaction*. Reference to this subtransaction will be used
/// as a connection to create `StorageProcessor` objects in test.
///
/// Having a subtransaction is necessary: even if some component will (mistakenly) will not
/// initiate a transaction and will call `commit` on `StorageProcessor`, changes won't be
/// persisted, since top-level transaction will be dropped.
///
/// At the same time, using *reference* to the subtransaction in created `StorageProcessor`
/// objects is also necessary: upon `drop`, transaction gets discarded. It means that if we
/// use transaction and somewhere in test `StorageProcessor` is created, used without
/// transaction and then dropped (which is a normal use case for e.g. test setup) -- such
/// changes would be discarded and test will not execute correctly.
