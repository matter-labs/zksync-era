# Contribution Guidelines

Hello! Thanks for your interest in joining the mission to accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for personal
sovereignty! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet.

Note, however, that all the contributions are subject to review, and not every contribution is guaranteed to be merged.
It is highly advised to reach out to developers (for example, by creating an issue) before preparing a significant
change in the codebase, and explicitly confirm that this contribution will be considered for merge. Otherwise, it is
possible to discover that a feature you have spent some time on does not align with the core team vision or capacity to
maintain a high quality of given submission long term.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the ZK Stack:

1. Open issues: if you find a bug, have something you believe needs to be fixed, or have an idea for a feature, please
   open an issue.
2. Add color to existing issues: provide screenshots, code snippets, and whatever you think would be helpful to resolve
   issues.
3. Resolve issues: either by showing an issue isn't a problem and the current state is ok as is or by fixing the problem
   and opening a PR.
4. Report security issues, see [our security policy](./SECURITY.md).
5. [Join the team!](https://matterlabs.notion.site/Shape-the-future-of-Ethereum-at-Matter-Labs-dfb3b5a037044bb3a8006af2eb0575e0)

## Fixing issues

To contribute code fixing issues, please fork the repo, fix an issue, commit, add documentation as per the PR template,

## FAQ

**Q**: I have a small contribution that's not getting traction/being merged?

**A**: Due to capacity, contributions that are simple renames of variables or stylistic/minor text improvements, one-off
typo fix will not be merged.
