# Contracts

Contracts are used throughout the codebase. The core or the L2 system is coded in smart contracts, these can be found in [zkEVM documentation](./zkevm/overview.md)

The chain uses contracts to [settle](./settlement_contracts/overview.md). 

Chain admins use contracts on L1 to [manage](./chain_management/overview.md) the chain.

Contracts are also used to [bridge](./bridging/overview.md) assets between chains.
