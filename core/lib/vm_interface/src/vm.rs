//! This module contains traits for the VM interface.
//! All VMs should implement these traits to be used in our system.
//! The trait is generic over the storage type, allowing it to be used with any storage implementation.
//! Additionally, this trait is generic over HistoryMode, allowing it to be used with or without history.
//!
//! `TracerDispatcher` is an associated type used to dispatch tracers in VMs.
//! It manages tracers across different VM versions.
//! Even though we use the same interface for all VM versions,
//! we can now specify only the necessary trait bounds for each VM version.
//!
//! Generally speaking, in most cases, the tracer dispatcher is a wrapper around `Vec<Box<dyn VmTracer>>`,
//! where `VmTracer` is a trait implemented for a specific VM version.
