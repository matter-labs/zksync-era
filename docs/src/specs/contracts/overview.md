# Contracts

Contracts are used throughout the codebase. The core or the L2 system is coded in smart contracts, these can be found in [l2_system_contracts][TODO]

The chain uses contracts to [settle][TODO]. 

Chain admins use contracts on L1 to [manage](./chain_management/overview.md) the chain.

Contracts are also used to [bridge][TODO] assets between chains.
