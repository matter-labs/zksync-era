//! `transactions` is module that holds the essential information for every transaction.
//!
//! Since in ZKsync Era every operation can be executed either from the contract or rollup,
//! it makes more sense to define the contents of each transaction chain-agnostic, and extent this data
//! with metadata (such as fees and/or signatures) for L1 and L2 separately.
