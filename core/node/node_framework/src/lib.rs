//! # ZK Stack node initialization framework.
//!
//! This crate provides core abstractions that allow one to compose a ZK Stack node.
//! Main concepts used in this crate are:
//! - [`WiringLayer`](wiring_layer::WiringLayer) - builder interface for tasks.
//! - [`Task`](task::Task) - a unit of work that can be executed by the node.
//! - [`Resource`](resource::Resource) - a piece of logic that can be shared between tasks. Most resources are
//!   represented by generic interfaces and also serve as points of customization for tasks.
//! - [`ZkStackService`](service::ZkStackService) - a container for tasks and resources that takes care of initialization, running
//!   and shutting down.
//! - [`ZkStackServiceBuilder`](service::ZkStackServiceBuilder) - a builder for the service.
