# Pruning

It is possible to configure ZKsync Node to periodically remove all data from batches older than a configurable
threshold. Data is pruned both from Postgres and from tree (RocksDB).

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you need a node with data retention period of up to a few days, please set up a node from a
> [_snapshot_](07_snapshots_recovery.md) and wait for it to have enough data. Pruning an archival node can take
> unpractical amount of time. In the future we will be offering pre-pruned DB snapshots with a few months of data.

## Configuration

You can enable pruning by setting the environment variable

```yaml
EN_PRUNING_ENABLED: 'true'
```

By default, it will keep history for 7 days. You can configure retention period using:

```yaml
EN_PRUNING_DATA_RETENTION_SEC: '259200' # 3 days
```

The data retention can be set to any value, but for mainnet values under 21h will be ignored as the batch can only be
pruned as soon as it has been executed on Ethereum.

## Storage requirements for pruned nodes

The storage requirements depend on how long you configure to retain the data, but are roughly:

- **40GB + ~5GB/day of retained data** of disk space needed on machine that runs the node
- **300GB + ~15GB/day of retained data** of disk space for Postgres

> When pruning an existing archival node, Postgres will be unable to reclaim disk space automatically, to reclaim disk
> space, you need to manually run VACUUM FULL, which requires an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock, you can read more about it in
> [_postgres docs_](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html)
