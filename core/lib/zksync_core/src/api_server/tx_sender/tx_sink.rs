/// An abstraction of "destination" for transactions that should be propagated to the mempool.
///
/// By default, `TxSender` always has access to the Postgres replica pool, but this only provides read-only progress.
/// However, `TxSender` should be able to propagate transactions as well, and for that purpose the implementation may
/// be different. For example, main node has access to the master pool, and external node has a proxy that submits
/// transaction to the main node.
///
/// Both approaches represent different implementations of `TxSink` trait.
///
/// Additionally, `TxSink` may be stateful: e.g. if the effects of transaction submission are not immediately visible
/// through the replica pool, `TxSink` may implement methods to allow cache-like lookups. These methods are not mandatory
/// and may be implemented as no-ops.
