# Interop Overview

This section provides up-to-date information about interop components (and components directly related to interop) that are either already part of mainnet or whose development is complete and awaiting a protocol upgrade for inclusion.

As a prerequisite to understanding the interop mechanism, the reader should familiarize themselves with the following documents:

- [Message Root](./message_root.md)
- [Forms of Finality](./forms_of_finality.md)

To date, we have completed the implementation of the foundational layer for all interop functionality: [cross-chain messages](./interop_messages.md).

Once youâ€™ve reviewed the above, you can explore examples of interop applications [here](./examples/README.md).
