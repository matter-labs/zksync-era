# Understanding zkSync's Use of 4844 Blob Transactions

This article explains how zkSync is utilizing the new type of transaction called 4844
blob transactions to commit to the public data (pubdata) to Ethereum Layer 1 (L1).

We will skip the technical details of 4844 blobs and focus on how zkSync specifically implements them.

## Before 4844: The Era of Calldata

Originally, before the introduction of 4844 blobs, the system worked differently. In this period, known as the pre-4844
era, zkSync would collect all its pubdata, which could be up to 120kb. This data was then sent as 'calldata' of the
commitBatches transaction.

In these transactions, the contract would calculate a keccak hash of the data and use this hash in the proving process.
More precisely, this hash was stored as part of the block commitment and later used in the `proveBatches` function.

## The Change with 4844 Blob Transactions

The introduction of 4844 blobs brought several significant changes:

- Blob transactions have their own fee market. This means the cost of using blobs can be different from the cost of
  using gas.
- Users must pay for a whole blob, which is 128kb, regardless of how much data they actually use. This differs from
  calldata, where payment was based on the amount of data sent.
- The contents of the blobs are not directly accessible. Instead, they contain unique KZG commitments and precompiles.

**In the first version, we will be using up to 2 blobs per batch - so 256kb of pubdata**

In this article, we will mainly discuss how we adapted our system, including our proving system, to work with these KZG
commitments.

**Why did Ethereum introduce these commitments instead of continuing with the previous hash-based system?**

The short answer is, that while the current version of Ethereum doesn't gain much from this change, the next version,
known as 'full Danksharding,' will greatly benefit from these commitments, as they will allow the addition of many more
blobs.

## Technical details

Let's go back to our problem statement:

**We have 128kb of data in L2, and we want to prove on L1 that it was correctly 'attached' to L1 (that is - that it was
made available).**

This verification is done in 14 steps, divided into three parts: inside the prover, inside the state keeper, and finally
within the L1 contract.

### Inside the prover

Most of this is done in either witness generator or a new circuit type 4844:

| step                       | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Split data                 | Divide the data into 4096 units of 256-bit points.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Create Polynomial          | Form a polynomial `p` that passes through these points. For more clarity on this, refer to [Blobspace 101][blobspace_101]                                                                                                                    |
| Trusted setup              | Obtain the [trusted setup][trusted_setup] from Ethereum's KZG ceremony (also known as the secret point 's').                                                                                                                                 |
| Compute Commitment         | [Calculate the commitment][compute_commitment] `(c = p(s))`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Versioned Hash:            | Generate a versioned hash (`vh = hash(c)`) which is more flexible and smaller in size than the commitment. (32 bytes vs 48)                                                                                                                  |
| Choose a Random Point:     | Select a 'random' point `x = hash(hash(data) \|\| vh)` using the [hash of the data and the versioned hash][random_point_selection]. This is ['Fiat-Shamir' heuristic][fiat_shamir]                                                           |
| Compute Polynomial Value:  | Calculate the value `p(x) = y`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Prepare for Circuit Input: | Ensure that `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` is provided as a [public input for the circuit][scheduler_expect_4844], based on the [Schwarz-Zippel lemma][schwarz_zippel] - if 2 polynomials are equal in a random point, there are equal everywhere. |

### Inside the state keeper

| step                         | explanation                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Collect data                 | Get `c`, `x`, `y`, `blob_proof` from witness generator |
| Create New Transaction Type: | Form a new blob transaction with a special `0x3` type. |

### Inside the L1 contract

| step                             | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Receive Inputs:                  | Get `c`, `x`, `y`, and `blob_proof` as inputs from the [state keeper][executor_inputs].                                                                                                                                  |
| Verification Hash:               | Obtain the verification hash through the BLOB_HASH precompile. [`_getBlobVersionedHash`][get_blob_vhash]                                                                                                                 |
| Use Precompile for Verification: | Apply a [precompile][precompile_4844] to check if `p(x) == y` using the version hash, `c` and `blob_proof`. This is where the KZG scheme plays a crucial role, allowing the proof without needing the entire polynomial. |
| Pass Public Input to Verifier    | Send `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` as public input to the verifier using [`_batchAuxiliaryOutput`][executor_aux].                                                                                                             |

This process simplifies how zkSync validates the attachment of 128kb of L2 data to L1, ensuring its correctness and
integrity.

### What, but why

#### Why does prover need to compute the commitment

Prover needs to come up with a 'random' point 'x' (otherwise Schwarz-Zippel lemma would not work), so it has to generate
based on something. The simpler solution would be to generate it based on the hash of the pubdata, but unfortunately the
L1 contract doesn't have access to the hash - so it would not be able to verify that the 'x' was really generated based
on that hash.

#### Why do I need to pass blob proof to L1 contract

The execution layer only knows that a consensus layer has a blob with a given hash, and nothing more. So in order to 
prove anything about the contents of the blob, you (as a caller) have to provide all the information. It is similar to
someone storing a full merkle tree, and you knowing only the root hash. If you want to prove the inclusion 
the caller has to provide the full merkle path.

#### Why do I need to pass this information into the aux inputs of verifier

While we say, that verifier accepts public inputs (plural) - in practice it accepts a single hash, that is an aggregated
keccak of all the inputs.

And passing all the information there, is the only way to make sure that operator was not malicious (otherwise, operator
could pass some other data in a blob, with correct `x` and `y` etc, that would be completely different from the one that
prover was actually proving).

#### Why do you say that point 's' is secret if I can simply download it

That was a mental shortcut and simplification. You can Google for `KZG ceremony` to understand more, how it works.

#### I thought that trusted setup is huge

When we are using KZG for our ZK proofs, we use `2^24` trusted setup (so 16M parameters), while with old proof system,
we even used `2^26`.

For 4844, as blobs have 'only' 4096 elements we use `2^12` trusted setup (so exactly 4096 one) - it is right here [in
the json file][trusted_setup_json]

### Some additional code pointers

Our proof (as a part of the input), expects these 2 additional fields in [Scheduler AUX inputs][scheduler_aux]

```rust
pub struct BlockAuxilaryOutput<F: SmallField> {
    // ...
    pub eip4844_linear_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
    // these are:  keccak(versioned hash || opening point || evaluation value)
    pub eip4844_output_commitment_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
}

```

We prepare this object inside the [Executor.sol][executor_aux]:

```solidity
bytes32 auxiliaryOutputHash = keccak256(
    _batchAuxiliaryOutput(_newBatchData, _stateDiffHash, _blobCommitments, _blobHashes)
);
```
