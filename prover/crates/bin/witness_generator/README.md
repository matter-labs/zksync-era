for rationale of this binary, alongside the existing one in zk-core.

The component is responsible for generating prover jobs and saving artifacts needed for the next round of proof
aggregation. That is, every aggregation round needs two sets of input:

- computed proofs from the previous round
- some artifacts that the witness generator of previous round(s) returns. There are four rounds of proofs for every
  block, each of them starts with an invocation of `{Round}WitnessGenerator` with a corresponding
  `WitnessGeneratorJobType`:

## BasicCircuitsWitnessGenerator

- generates basic circuits (circuits like `Main VM` - up to 50 \* 48 = 2400 circuits):
- input table: `basic_circuit_witness_jobs` (TODO SMA-1362: will be renamed from `witness_inputs`)
- artifact/output table: `leaf_aggregation_jobs` (also creates job stubs in `node_aggregation_jobs` and
  `scheduler_aggregation_jobs`) value in `aggregation_round` field of `prover_jobs` table: 0

## LeafAggregationWitnessGenerator

- generates leaf aggregation circuits (up to 48 circuits of type `LeafAggregation`)
- input table: `leaf_aggregation_jobs`
- artifact/output table: `node_aggregation_jobs`
- value in `aggregation_round` field of `prover_jobs` table: 1

## NodeAggregationWitnessGenerator

- generates one circuit of type `NodeAggregation`
- input table: `leaf_aggregation_jobs`
- value in `aggregation_round` field of `prover_jobs` table: 2

## SchedulerWitnessGenerator

- generates one circuit of type `Scheduler`
- input table: `scheduler_witness_jobs`
- value in `aggregation_round` field of `prover_jobs` table: 3

One round of prover generation consists of:

- `WitnessGenerator` picks up the next `queued` job in its input table and processes it (invoking the corresponding
  helper function in `zkevm_test_harness` repo)
- it saves the generated circuits to `prover_jobs` table and the other artifacts to its output table
- the individual proofs are picked up by the provers, processed, and marked as complete.
- when the last proof for this round is computed, the prover updates the row in the output table setting its status to
  `queued`
- `WitnessGenerator` picks up such job and proceeds to the next round

Note that the very first input table (`witness_inputs`) is populated by the tree (as the input artifact for the
`WitnessGeneratorJobType::BasicCircuits` is the merkle proofs)

## Running BWG for custom batch

After releases `prover-v15.1.0` and `core-v24.9.0` basic witness generator doesn't need access to core database anymore.
That means, that you can actually run it locally without additional setup(but if need to have proof generation data
generated by different core components).
