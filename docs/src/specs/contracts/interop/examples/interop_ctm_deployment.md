## Generic usage of `BridgeHub.requestL2TransactionTwoBridges`

`L1AssetRouter` is the only bridge that can handle base tokens. However, the `BridgeHub.requestL2TransactionTwoBridges` could be used by `secondBridgeAddress` on L1. A notable example of how it is done is how our [CTMDeploymentTracker](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/b43cf6b3b069c85aec3cd61d33dd3ae2c462c896/l1-contracts/contracts/bridgehub/CTMDeploymentTracker.sol) uses it to register the correct CTM address on Gateway. You can read more about how Gateway works in [its documentation](../../gateway/overview.md).

Let’s do a quick recap on how it works:

When calling `BridgeHub.requestL2TransactionTwoBridges` the following struct needs to be provided:

```solidity
struct L2TransactionRequestTwoBridgesOuter {
  uint256 chainId;
  uint256 mintValue;
  uint256 l2Value;
  uint256 l2GasLimit;
  uint256 l2GasPerPubdataByteLimit;
  address refundRecipient;
  address secondBridgeAddress;
  uint256 secondBridgeValue;
  bytes secondBridgeCalldata;
}
```

- `secondBridgeAddress` is the address of the L1 contract that needs to perform the L1->L2 transaction.
- `secondBridgeValue` is the `msg.value` to be sent to the `secondBridgeAddress`.
- `secondBridgeCalldata` is the data to pass to the `secondBridgeAddress`. This can be interpreted any way it wants.

1. Firstly, the Bridgehub will deposit the `request.mintValue` the same way as during a simple L1→L2 transaction. These funds will be used for funding the `l2Value` and the fee to the operator.
2. After that, the `secondBridgeAddress.bridgehubDeposit` with the following signature is called

```solidity
struct L2TransactionRequestTwoBridgesInner {
  // Should be equal to a constant `keccak256("TWO_BRIDGES_MAGIC_VALUE")) - 1`
  bytes32 magicValue;
  // The L2 contract to call
  address l2Contract;
  // The calldata to call it with
  bytes l2Calldata;
  // The factory deps to call it with
  bytes[] factoryDeps;
  // Just some 32-byte value that can be used for later processing
  // It is called `txDataHash` as it *should* be used as a way to facilitate
  // reclaiming failed deposits.
  bytes32 txDataHash;
}

function bridgehubDeposit(
  uint256 _chainId,
  // The actual user that does the deposit
  address _prevMsgSender,
  // The msg.value of the L1->L2 transaction to be created
  uint256 _l2Value,
  // Custom bridge-specific data
  bytes calldata _data
) external payable returns (L2TransactionRequestTwoBridgesInner memory request);
```

Now the job of the contract will be to “validate” whether they are okay with the transaction to come. For instance, the `CTMDeploymentTracker` checks that the `_prevMsgSender` is the owner of `CTMDeploymentTracker` and has the necessary rights to perform the transaction out of the name of it.

Ultimately, the correctly processed `bridgehubDeposit` function basically grants `BridgeHub` the right to create an L1→L2 transaction out of the name of the `secondBridgeAddress`. Since it is so powerful, the first returned value must be a magical constant that is equal to `keccak256("TWO_BRIDGES_MAGIC_VALUE")) - 1`. The fact that it was a somewhat non standard signature and a struct with the magical value is the major defense against “accidental” approvals to start a transaction out of the name of an account.

Aside from the magical constant, the method should also return the information an L1→L2 transaction will start its call with: the `l2Contract` , `l2Calldata`, `factoryDeps`. It also should return the `txDataHash` field. The meaning `txDataHash` will be needed in the next paragraphs. But generally it can be any 32-byte value the bridge wants.

1. After that, an L1→L2 transaction is invoked. Note, that the “trusted” `L1AssetRouter` has enforced that the baseToken was deposited correctly (again, the step (1) can _only_ be handled by the `L1AssetRouter`), while the second bridge can provide any data to call its L2 counterpart with.
2. As a final step, following function is called:

```solidity
function bridgehubConfirmL2Transaction(
  // `chainId` of the ZKChain
  uint256 _chainId,
  // the same value that was returned by `bridgehubDeposit`
  bytes32 _txDataHash,
  // the hash of the L1->L2 transaction
  bytes32 _txHash
) external;
```

This function is needed for whatever actions are needed to be done after the L1→L2 transaction has been invoked.

On `L1AssetRouter` it is used to remember the hash of each deposit transaction, so that later on, the funds could be returned to user if the `L1->L2` transaction fails. The `_txDataHash` is stored so that the whenever the users will want to reclaim funds from a failed deposit, they would provide the token and the amount as well as the sender to send the money to.
