/// re-organize transactions in them to fix the problem.

/// and in the event of mismatch, we know that there has been a reorg.
/// We then perform a binary search to find the latest correct block
/// and revert all batches after it, to keep being consistent with the main node.

/// This is the only component that is expected to finish its execution
/// in the even of reorg, since we have to restart the node after a rollback is performed,
