//! Tasks define the "runnable" concept of the service, e.g. a unit of work that can be executed by the service.
//!
//! ## Task kinds
//!
//! This module defines different flavors of tasks.
//! The most basic one is [`Task`], which is only launched after all the preconditions are met (more on this later),
//! and is expected to run until the node is shut down. This is the most common type of task, e.g. API server,
//! state keeper, and metadata calculator are examples of such tasks.
//!
//! Then there exists an [`OneshotTask`], which has a clear exit condition that does not cause the node to shut down.
//! This is useful for tasks that are expected to run once and then exit, e.g. a task that performs a programmatic
//! migration.
//!
//! Finally, the task can be unconstrained by preconditions, which means that it will start immediately without
//! waiting for any preconditions to be met. This kind of tasks is represent by [`UnconstrainedTask`] and
//! [`UnconstrainedOneshotTask`].
//!
//! ## Tasks and preconditions
//!
//! Besides tasks, service also has a concept of preconditions(crate::precondition::Precondition). Precondition is a
//! piece of logic that is expected to be met before the task can start. One can think of preconditions as a way to
//! express invariants that the tasks may rely on.
//!
//! In this notion, the difference between a task and an unconstrained task is that the former has all the invariants
//! checked already, and unrestricted task is responsible for *manually checking any invariants it may rely on*.
//!
//! The unrestricted tasks are rarely needed, but two common cases for them are:
//! - A task that must be started as soon as possible, e.g. healthcheck server.
//! - A task that may be a driving force for some precondition to be met.
