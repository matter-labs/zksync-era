# System Contracts

Many EVM instructions require special handling by the
[System Contracts](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/system-contracts.html). Among them are: `ORIGIN`,
`CALLVALUE`, `BALANCE`, `CREATE`, `SHA3`, and others. To see the full detailed list of instructions requiring special
handling, see
[the EVM instructions reference](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/docs/VM%20Section/How%20compiler%20works/instructions/evm).

There are several types of System Contracts from the perspective of how they are handled by the zkSync Era compilers:

1. [Environmental data storage](#environmental-data-storage).
2. [KECCAK256 hash function](#keccak256-hash-function).
3. [Contract deployer](#contract-deployer).
4. [Ether value simulator](#ether-value-simulator).
5. [Simulator of immutables](#simulator-of-immutables).
6. [Event handler](#event-handler).

### Environmental Data Storage

Such storage contracts are accessed with static calls in order to retrieve values for the block, transaction, and other
environmental entities: `CHAINID`, `DIFFICULTY`, `BLOCKHASH`, etc.

One good example of such contract is
[SystemContext](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-system-contracts/blob/main/contracts/SystemContext.sol) that provides
the majority of the environmental data.

Since EVM is not using external calls for these instructions, we must use [the auxiliary heap](#auxiliary-heap) for
their calldata.

Steps to handle such instructions:

1. Store the calldata for the System Contract call on the auxiliary heap.
2. Call the System Contract with a static call.
3. Check the return status code of the call.
4. [Revert or throw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/docs/VM%20Section/How%20compiler%20works/exception_handling.md)
   if the status code is zero.
5. Read the ABI data and extract the result. All such System Contracts return a single 256-bit value.
6. Return the value as the result of the original instruction.

For reference, see
[the LLVM IR codegen source code](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/context/function/llvm_runtime.rs).

### KECCAK256 Hash Function

Handling of this function is similar to [Environmental Data Storage](#environmental-data-storage) with one difference:

Since EVM also uses heap to store the calldata for `KECCAK256`, the required memory chunk is allocated by the IR
generator, and zkSync Era compiler does not need to use [the auxiliary heap](#auxiliary-heap).

For reference, see
[the LLVM IR codegen source code](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/context/function/llvm_runtime.rs).

### Contract Deployer

See [handling CREATE](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#create-create2)
and
[dependency code substitution instructions](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#datasize-dataoffset-datacopy)
on zkSync Era documentation.

For reference, see LLVM IR codegen for
[the deployer call](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/context/function/runtime/deployer_call.rs)
and
[CREATE-related instructions](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/evm/create.rs).

### Ether Value Simulator

EraVM does not support passing Ether natively, so this is handled by a special System Contract called
[MsgValueSimulator](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-system-contracts/blob/main/contracts/MsgValueSimulator.sol).

An external call is redirected through the simulator if the following conditions are met:

1. The
   [call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/docs/VM%20Section/How%20compiler%20works/instructions/evm/call.md)
   has the Ether value parameter.
2. The Ether value is non-zero.

The call to the simulator requires extra data passed via ABI using registers:

1. Ether value.
2. The address of the contract to call.
3. The system call bit, which is only set if a call to the [ContractDeployer](#contract-deployer) is being redirected,
   that is `CREATE` or `CREATE2` is called with non-zero Ether.

For reference, see
[the LLVM IR codegen source code](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/evm/call.rs#L530).

### Simulator of Immutables

See
[handling immutables](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#setimmutable-loadimmutable)
on zkSync Era documentation.

For reference, see LLVM IR codegen for
[instructions for immutables](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/evm/immutable.rs)
and
[RETURN from the deploy code](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/evm/return.rs#L28).

### Event Handler

Event payloads are sent to a special System Contract called
[EventWriter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/system-contracts/contracts/EventWriter.yul).
Like on EVM, the payload consists of topics and data:

1. The topics with a length-prefix are passed via ABI using registers.
2. The data is passed via the default heap, like on EVM.

For reference, see
[the LLVM IR codegen source code](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm-context/blob/main/src/eravm/evm/event.rs).

## Auxiliary Heap

Both [zksolc](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/compiler-toolchain/solidity.html) and
[zkvyper](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/compiler-toolchain/vyper.html) compilers for EraVM operate on
[the IR level](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/compiler-toolchain/overview.html#ir-compilers), so they cannot control
the heap memory allocator which remains a responsibility of
[the high-level source code compilers](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/compiler-toolchain/overview.html#high-level-source-code-compilers)
emitting the IRs.

However, the are several cases where EraVM needs to allocate memory on the heap and EVM does not. The auxiliary heap is
used for these cases:

1. [Returning immutables](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#setimmutable-loadimmutable)
   from the constructor.
2. Allocating calldata and return data for calling the
   [System Contracts](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/system-contracts.html).
