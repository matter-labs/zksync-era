# How L2 to L1 messaging works

In this article, we will explore the workings of Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1) messaging in zkSync Era.

If you're uncertain about why messaging is necessary in the first place, please refer to our [user
documentation][user_docs].

For ease of understanding, here's a quick visual guide. We will unpack each part in detail as we progress.

![overview image][overview_image]

## Part 1 - User Generates a Message

Consider the following contract. Its main function is to forward any received string to L1:

```solidity
contract Messenger {
  function sendMessage(string memory message) public returns (bytes32 messageHash) {
    messageHash = L1_MESSENGER_CONTRACT.sendToL1(bytes(message));
  }
}

```

From a developer's standpoint, you only need to invoke the `sendToL1` method, and your task is complete.

It's worth noting, however, that transferring data to L1 typically incurs high costs. These costs are associated with
the 'pubdata cost' that is charged for each byte in the message. As a workaround, many individuals choose to send the
hash of the message instead of the full message, as this helps to conserve resources.

## Part 2 - System Contract Execution

The previously mentioned `sendToL1` method executes a call to the `L1Messenger.sol` system contract
[here][l1_messenger]. This system contract performs tasks such as computing the appropriate gas cost and hashes, and
then it broadcasts an Event carrying the complete message.

```solidity
function sendToL1(bytes calldata _message) external override returns (bytes32 hash) {
  // ...
  SystemContractHelper.toL1(true, bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender))), hash);
  emit L1MessageSent(msg.sender, hash, _message);
}

```

As depicted in the leading image, this stage is where the message data splits. The full body of the message is emitted
for retrieval in Part 5 by the StateKeeper, while the hash of the message proceeds to be added to the Virtual Machine
(VM) - as it has to be included in the proof.

The method then sends the message's hash to the `SystemContractHelper`, which makes an internal call:

```solidity
function toL1(
  bool _isService,
  bytes32 _key,
  bytes32 _value
) internal {
  // ...
  address callAddr = TO_L1_CALL_ADDRESS;
  assembly {
    call(_isService, callAddr, _key, _value, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
  }
}

```

Following the `TO_L1_CALL_ADDRESS`, we discover that it's set to a placeholder value. So what exactly is occurring here?

## Part 3 - Compiler Tricks and the EraVM

Our VM features special opcodes designed to manage operations that aren't possible in the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM), such as publishing data to L1. But how can we make these features accessible to Solidity?

We could expand the language by introducing new Solidity opcodes, but that would require modifying the solc compiler,
among other things. Hence, we've adopted a different strategy.

To access these unique eraVM opcodes, the Solidity code simply executes a call to a specific address (the full list can
be seen [here][list_of_opcodes]). This call is compiled by the solc frontend, and then on the compiler backend, we
intercept it and replace it with the correct eraVM opcode call [here][opcode_catch_compiler].

```rust
match simulation_address {
  Some(compiler_common::ADDRESS_TO_L1) => {
    return crate::zkevm::general::to_l1(context, is_first, in_0, in_1);
  }
}
```

This method allows your message to reach the VM.

## Part 4 - Inside the Virtual Machine

The zkEVM assembly translates these [opcodes][zkevm_assembly_parse] into LogOpcodes.

```rust
pub const ALL_CANONICAL_MODIFIERS: [&'static str; 5] =
    ["sread", "swrite", "event", "to_l1", "precompile"];
let variant = match idx {
  0 => LogOpcode::StorageRead,
  1 => LogOpcode::StorageWrite,
  2 => LogOpcode::Event,
  3 => LogOpcode::ToL1Message,
  4 => LogOpcode::PrecompileCall,
}
```

Each opcode is then converted into the corresponding [LogOpcode][log_opcode] and written into the Log
[here][log_writing_in_vm], which is handled by the EventSink oracle.

## Part 5 - The Role of the State Keeper

At this stage, the state keeper needs to collect all the messages generated by the VM execution and append them to the
calldata it transmits to Ethereum.

This process is divided into two steps:

- Retrieval of the 'full' messages
- Extraction of all the message hashes.

Why are these steps kept separate?

To avoid overwhelming our circuits with the content of entire messages, we relay them through Events, sending only their
hash to the VM. In this manner, the VM only adds to the proof the information that a message with a specific hash was
sent.

### Retrieving Full Message Contents

We go through all the Events generated during the run [here][iterate_over_events] and identify those coming from the
`L1_MESSENGER_ADDRESS` that correspond to the `L1MessageSent` topic. These Events represent the 'emit' calls executed in
Part 2.

### Retrieving Message Hashes

Message hashes are transmitted alongside the other `l2_to_l1_logs` within the [VmExecutionResult][vm_execution_result].

The StateKeeper collects them from the [LogQueries][log_queries] that the VM creates (these log queries also contain
information about storage writes, so we use the AUX_BYTE filter to determine which ones contain L1 messages. The entire
list can be found [here][aux_bytes]). The StateKeeper employs the VM's EventSink to filter them out [here][event_sink].

## Part 6 - Interaction with Ethereum (L1)

After the StateKeeper has collected all the required data, it invokes the `CommitBlocks` method from the
[Executor.sol][executor_sol] contract.

Inside the `processL2Blocks` method, we iterate through the list of L2 message hashes, ensuring that the appropriate
full text is present for each:

```solidity
// show preimage for hashed message stored in log
if (logSender == L2_TO_L1_MESSENGER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT_ADDR) {
    (bytes32 hashedMessage, ) = UnsafeBytes.readBytes32(emittedL2Logs, i + 56);
    // check that the full message body matches the hash.
    require(keccak256(l2Messages[currentMessage]) == hashedMessage, "k2");
```

Currently, the executor is deployed on Ethereum mainnet at
[0x389a081BCf20e5803288183b929F08458F1d863D][mainnet_executor].

You can view an example of our contract execution from Part 1, carrying the message "My sample message", in this Sepolia
transaction: [0x18c2a113d18c53237a4056403047ff9fafbf772cb83ccd44bb5b607f8108a64c][sepolia_tx].

## Part 7 - Verifying Message Inclusion

We've now arrived at the final stage â€” how L1 users and contracts can confirm a message's presence in L1.

This is accomplished through the `ProveL2MessageInclusion` function call in [Mailbox.sol][mailbox_log_inclusion].

Users supply the proof (merkle path) and the message, and the contract verifies that the merkle path is accurate and
matches the root hash.

```solidity
bytes32 calculatedRootHash = Merkle.calculateRoot(_proof, _index, hashedLog);
bytes32 actualRootHash = s.l2LogsRootHashes[_blockNumber];

return actualRootHash == calculatedRootHash;
```

## Summary

In this article, we've travelled through a vast array of topics: from a user contract dispatching a message to L1 by
invoking a system contract, to this message's hash making its way all the way to the VM via special opcodes. We've also
explored how it's ultimately included in the execution results (as part of QueryLogs), gathered by the State Keeper, and
transmitted to L1 for final verification.
