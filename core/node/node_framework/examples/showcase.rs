/// and another layer to fetch it. The benefit here is that if you want to swap the database
/// implementation, you only have to inject a different wiring layer for database, and the
/// wiring layers for the tasks will remain unchanged.

///
/// - `()` can be used if you don't need inputs or don't produce outputs
/// - Any type `T` or `Option<T>` that implements `Resource` also implements both [`FromContext`]
///   and [`IntoContext`]. This can be handy if you work with a single resource.
