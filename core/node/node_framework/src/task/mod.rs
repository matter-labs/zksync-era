/// A task implementation.
/// Task defines the "runnable" concept of the service, e.g. a unit of work that can be executed by the service.
///
/// Based on the task kind, the implemenation will be treated differently by the service.
///
/// ## Task kinds
///
/// There may be different kinds of tasks:
///
/// ### `Task`
///
/// A regular task. Returning from this task will cause the service to stop. [`Task::kind`] has a default
/// implementation that returns `TaskKind::Task`.
///
/// Typically, the implementation of [`Task::run`] will be some form of loop that runs until either an
/// irrecoverable error happens (then task should return an error), or stop signal is received (then task should
/// return `Ok(())`).
///
/// ### `OneshotTask`
///
/// A task that can exit when completed without causing the service to terminate.
/// In case of `OneshotTask`s, the service will only exit when all the `OneshotTask`s have exited and there are
/// no more tasks running.
///
/// ### `Precondition`
///
/// A "barrier" task that is supposed to check invariants before the main tasks are started.
/// An example of a precondition task could be a task that checks if the database has all the required data.
/// Precondition tasks are often paired with some other kind of task that will make sure that the precondition
/// can be satisfied. This is required for a distributed service setup, where the precondition task will be
/// present on all the nodes, while a task that satisfies the precondition will be present only on one node.
///
/// ### `UnconstrainedTask`
///
/// A task that can run without waiting for preconditions.
/// Tasks of this kind are expected to check all the invariants they rely on themselves.
/// Usually, this kind of task is used either for tasks that must start as early as possible (e.g. healthcheck server),
/// or for tasks that cannot rely on preconditions.
///
/// ### `UnconstrainedOneshotTask`
///
/// A task that can run without waiting for preconditions and can exit without stopping the service.
/// Usually such tasks may be used for satisfying a precondition, for example, they can perform the database
/// setup.
