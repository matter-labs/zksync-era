| Yul                              | One of the Solidity IRs. Is a superset of the assembly available in Solidity. Used by default for contracts written in Solidity ≥0.8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| EVMLA                            | One of the Solidity IRs called EVM legacy assembly. Is a predecessor of Yul, but must closer to the pure EVM bytecode. Used by default for contracts written in Solidity <0.8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Translated into the EraVM bytecode by the EraVM assembler/linker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Stack                            | The segment of the non-persistent contract memory. Consists of two parts: 1. The global data, accessible from anywhere. Available to the compiler, not available to the user code. 2. The function-local stack frame without the depth limit like in EVM.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Heap                             | The segment of the non-persistent contract memory. All the data is globally accessible by both the compiler and user code. The allocation is handled by the solc’s Yul/EVMLA allocator only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Auxiliary heap                   | The segment of the non-persistent contract memory, introduced to avoid conflicts with the solc’s allocator. All the data is globally accessible by the compiler only. The allocation is handled by the zksolc’s compiler only. All contract calls specific to zkSync, including the system contracts, are made via the auxiliary heap. It is also used to return data (e.g. the array of immutables) from the constructor. |
| Calldata                         | The segment of the non-persistent contract memory. The heap or auxiliary heap of the parent/caller contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Return data                      | The segment of the non-persistent contract memory. The heap or auxiliary heap of the child/callee contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Contract storage                 | The persistent contract memory. No relevant differences from that of EVM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Contract context                 | The special storage of VM that keeps data like the current address, the caller’s address, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Instruction Set

The table below describes the scheme of translation Yul and EVMLA to EraVM bytecode.

At the moment it does not explain much of the LLVM IR and assembly aspects, but mainly focus on the EVM-equivalence for
the sake of assisting the upcoming audit.
