//! Merkle tree recovery logic.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! **Recovery process** is responsible for restoring a Merkle tree from a snapshot. A snapshot
//! consists of all tree entries at a specific tree version. As a result of recovery, we create
//! a Merkle tree with the same entries as the snapshot. Any changes that are applied to the tree
//! afterwards will have the same outcome as if they were applied to the original tree.
//!
//! Importantly, a recovered tree is only *observably* identical to the original tree; it differs
//! in (currently un-observable) node versions. In a recovered tree, all nodes will initially have
//! the same version (the snapshot version), while in the original tree, node versions are distributed
//! from 0 to the snapshot version (both inclusive).
//!
//! Recovery process proceeds as follows:
//!
//! 1. Initialize a tree in the recovery mode. Until recovery is finished, the tree cannot be accessed
//!   using ordinary [`MerkleTree`] APIs.
//! 2. Update the tree from a snapshot, which [is fed to the tree](MerkleTreeRecovery::extend())
//!   as [`RecoveryEntry`] chunks. Recovery entries must be ordered by increasing key.
//! 3. Finalize recovery using [`MerkleTreeRecovery::finalize()`]. To check integrity, you may compare
//!   [`MerkleTreeRecovery::root_hash()`] to the reference value.
//!
//! The recovery process is tolerant to crashes and may be resumed from the middle. To find the latest
//! recovered key, you may use [`MerkleTreeRecovery::last_processed_key()`].
//!
//! `RecoveryEntry` chunks are not validated during recovery. They can be authenticated using
//! [`TreeRangeDigest`](crate::TreeRangeDigest)s provided that the tree root hash is authenticated
//! using external means.
//!
//! # Implementation details
//!
//! We require `RecoveryEntry` ordering to simplify tracking the recovery progress. It also makes
//! node updates more efficient. Indeed, it suffices to load a leaf with the greatest key and its ancestors
//! before extending the tree; these nodes are guaranteed to be the *only* DB reads necessary
//! to insert new entries.
