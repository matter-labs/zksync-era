# zkSync v2 Project Architecture

This document will help you answer the question: _where can I find the logic for x?_ by giving a directory-tree style
structure of the physical architecture of the zkSync Era project.

## High-Level Overview

The zksync-2-dev repository has the following main units:

<ins>**Smart Contracts:**</ins> All the smart contracts in charge of the protocols on the L1 & L2. Some main contracts:

- L1 & L2 bridge contracts.
- The zkSync rollup contract on Ethereum.
- The L1 proof verifier contract.

**<ins>Core App:**</ins> The execution layer. A node running the zkSync network in charge of the following components:

- Monitoring the L1 smart contract for deposits or priority operations.
- Maintaining a mempool that receives transactions.
- Picking up transactions from the mempool, executing them in a VM, and changing the state accordingly.
- Generating zkSync chain blocks.
- Preparing circuits for executed blocks to be proved.
- Submitting blocks and proofs to the L1 smart contract.
- Exposing the Ethereum-compatible web3 API.

**<ins>Prover App:**</ins> The prover app takes blocks and metadata generated by the server and constructs a validity zk
proof for them.

**<ins>Storage Layer:**</ins> The different components and subcomponents don't communicate with each other directly via
APIs, rather via the single source of truth -- the db storage layer.
