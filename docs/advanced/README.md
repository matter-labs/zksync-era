# Advanced documentation

This documentation is aimed at advanced users who are interested in developing the zkSync Era itself (rather than just
the contracts on top) - and would like to understand how the system works internally.

The documents in this directory are not meant to be a full specification, but give you the rough understanding of the
system internals.

Suggested order of reading:

- [Initialization](01_initialization.md)
- [Deposits](02_deposits.md)
- [Withdrawals](03_withdrawals.md)
- [Contracts](contracts.md)
