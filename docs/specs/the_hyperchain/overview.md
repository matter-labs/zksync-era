# Overview

ZK Stack roll chains will be launched on L1 into a [shared bridge](./the_hyperchain/shared_bridge.md). The shared bridge
will create an ecosystem of chains, with shared standards, upgrades, and free flow of assets. This free flow of assets
will be enabled by [hyperbridges](./the_hyperchain/hyperbridges.md). Hyperbridges are trustless and cheap bridges
between hyperchains, allowing cross-chain function calls.
